## Exercise 2: Concepts
#############################################

## The following code performs a t test (covered in week 6) to compare mean monthly accident deaths between the
## years 1973 and 1978 in the US

t.test(USAccDeaths[1:12], USAccDeaths[61:72], alternative="greater")

## Look at the output and - without knowing the details of the underlying test - try to answer
## the following questions:

## a) Is the test significant at the alpha level of 0.05?

## b) What is the probability that this result is subject to a Type I error?

## c) Is this output also suited to tell you something about the Type II error probability?

## d) Is this test one-tailed or two-tailed?

## e) Do you think the test should be one-tailed or two-tailed?

### Exercise 3: Confidence interval
###############################################################

## A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain an 
## unknown population parameter.
## The population parameter is what we're trying to find out. 
## Navarro discusses this in more depth in chapter 10.


## a) What does a confidence interval mean from the perspective of experiment replication?

## b) please install and load packages sciplot and lsr

## c) We will be working with the dataset rivers, that lists the length of major US rivers. What does the following line do?
sample15 = sample(rivers,15)

## d) calculate 95% Confidence Intervals for rivers and sample15. You can
##    use the function ciMean()

## e) Why are the intervals different?

## f) We will now calculate the confidence interval for the mean of rivers by hand. 
##    A commonly used formula for 95% confidence intervals is meanÂ±1.96*SE

## g) Do your results align with the output of ciMean above? (There might be a bit of rounding error)

## h) Now, please calculate a 90% confidence interval without the ciMean function. 
##  Hint: You need to replace the 1.96, which is the 97.5 quantile of the normal distribution.

## i) Compare to the interval in g!

##  Exercise 4: Cleaning data
#################################################################################

## download the file insomnia25.csv from cms
## The made-up dataset insomnia contains data of a survey on 63 students. 
## They are asked two questions: whether they regularly encounter sleep problems
## and what their preferred and most consumed drink is.

## a. Load the libraries stringr, dplyr, tidyr and forcats

## b. read in the data

## c. get a summary of the dataset

## d. the variable sleepProblem should be a numerical variable and have 0 for no Problem 
##    and 1 for sleep problems.
##    Make sure that this is the case

## e. how many students encounter sleep problems?

## f. how many different drinks do students name? (transform the variable into a 
## factor first)

## g. collapse factor levels which were spelled wrong

## h. Assign your cleaned dataset to clean
